## Introduction
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features
- Encrypts text using the Caesar Cipher method.
- Decrypts text that was encrypted using the Caesar Cipher method.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase characters.
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
To use this program, you can either clone this repository and run the script directly, or copy the code into your own project.

### Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sammyoflightup/CaesarCipher.git
cd CaesarCipher
